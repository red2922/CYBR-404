## Jake Inthavongsa Career Center Summary and Goals
The Career Center presentation and activity afterward were very good. I’ve been to resume workshops hosted by UNK in the past so it was great to get a refresher. A couple of things I learned from this presentation include remembering to use resume paper and that it is important to network all the time. The resume paper is a little thing to remember that I usually just ignored in the past. I’ll work on creating a nice resume and then using resume paper to make my resume have more of an impact. I’ll also begin updating my LinkedIn and range profile to include accurate and up-to-date information.
